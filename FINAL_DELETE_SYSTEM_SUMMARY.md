## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced expenses table with soft delete support
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN deleted_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN deleted_by VARCHAR(36);
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_is_deleted ON expenses(is_deleted);
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /expense/<id>/delete        - Individual soft delete
POST /expense/<id>/restore       - Individual restore
POST /expenses/bulk-delete       - Bulk soft delete (rate limited)
POST /expenses/bulk-restore      - Bulk restore
POST /expenses/permanent-delete  - Permanent deletion
GET  /expenses/deleted          - Recently deleted page
GET  /admin/cleanup-stats       - Cleanup statistics
POST /admin/run-cleanup         - Manual cleanup trigger
```

### Enhanced Models
```python
class Expense(db.Model):
    # Soft delete fields
    is_deleted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False, index=True)
    deleted_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    deleted_by = db.Column(db.String(36), db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=True)
    
    def soft_delete(self, user_id):
        """Soft delete with user tracking"""
        
    def restore(self):
        """Restore deleted expense"""
        
    @classmethod
    def get_active_expenses(cls, user_id):
        """Get non-deleted expenses"""
        
    @classmethod
    def get_deleted_expenses(cls, user_id):
        """Get soft-deleted expenses"""
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+A** - Select all expenses
- **Ctrl+D** - Delete selected expenses
- **Escape** - Clear selection
- **Ctrl+Shift+A** - Clear selection

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Rate Limiting
```python
@rate_limit(max_requests=5, window_seconds=60)
def bulk_delete_expenses():
    """Prevents abuse with configurable limits"""
```

### CSRF Protection
```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}"/>
```

### User Ownership Validation
```python
expenses = Expense.query.filter(
    Expense.id.in_(expense_ids),
    Expense.user_id == current_user.id,
    Expense.is_deleted == False
).all()
```

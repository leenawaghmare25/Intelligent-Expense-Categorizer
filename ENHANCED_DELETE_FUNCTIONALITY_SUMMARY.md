## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added soft delete columns to expenses table
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN deleted_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN deleted_by VARCHAR(36);
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_is_deleted ON expenses(is_deleted);
```

### New API Endpoints
```
POST /expense/<id>/delete        - Soft delete individual expense
POST /expense/<id>/restore       - Restore individual expense
POST /expenses/bulk-delete       - Bulk soft delete
POST /expenses/bulk-restore      - Bulk restore
POST /expenses/permanent-delete  - Permanent deletion
GET  /expenses/deleted          - View recently deleted expenses
```

### Enhanced Models
```python
class Expense(db.Model):
    # Soft delete fields
    is_deleted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False, index=True)
    deleted_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    deleted_by = db.Column(db.String(36), db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=True)
    
    def soft_delete(self, user_id):
        """Soft delete the expense."""
        
    def restore(self):
        """Restore a soft-deleted expense."""
        
    @classmethod
    def get_active_expenses(cls, user_id):
        """Get all non-deleted expenses for a user."""
        
    @classmethod
    def get_deleted_expenses(cls, user_id):
        """Get all soft-deleted expenses for a user."""
```

### Enhanced Forms
```python
class BulkDeleteForm(FlaskForm):
    """Form for bulk deletion of expenses."""
    expense_ids = SelectMultipleField('Select Expenses', coerce=int)
    confirm_delete = BooleanField('I understand this action cannot be undone')

class DeleteConfirmationForm(FlaskForm):
    """Form for confirming individual expense deletion."""
    expense_id = HiddenField('Expense ID')
    confirm_delete = BooleanField('I understand this action cannot be undone')
```
